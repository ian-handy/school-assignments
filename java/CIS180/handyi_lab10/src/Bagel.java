/*Requirements:

If you are ready to move on, there are only 5 changes you need to make: 

   Change the code so there are now two more bagel options… Garlic and Gluten-free.  The price of each is 1.75 and 2.00 respectively. 

   Add strawberry jam as an option, and make it the same price as blueberry. 

   Change the look and feel to Motif (hint: do it in the  constructor before setVisible).  You’ll need to look up how to do this in the slides. 

   Instead of the layout going from Bagels->Toppings-> Coffee, change it so the layout is going from Coffee->Bagel->Toppings. 

   Make another change (other than the examples given above) to the GUI.  Changing a price does not count, moving things around does not count.  Creating something new (like a new button) will count.  TA’s will only check you off if it looks visually appealing (if there is a new button right in the middle of top of the window, this does not flow well). 

Check-off points: 

   Make sure you commented everything…. All loops, methods, and attributes.  Also take credit for your work (Name, Date, description of the class) at the top of the each class. 

   If you believe you have completed this lab, have the TA check you off.  Once you are checked off for all portions, upload all .java files (only!) to myCourses.
