# CIS 181 - Lab 2

## The Jankle Bobit Calendar

## Overview

The calendar as we know it is the Gregorian calendar. It’s fairly simple to describe: twelve months in a year. April, June, September, November, have 30 days; February has 28, except on a leap year when it has 29, and all the rest have 31 days. Thankfully we have the Jankle Bobit calendar to mix up our lives.

The Jankle Bobit calendar has the following properties:

* A whopping total of 17 months in a year.
* The months have no names, but rather just numbers. 1 is the first month, 2 is the second month, 3 is the third month, and so on.
* Every even numbered month has 14 days
* Every odd numbered month has 45 days
* Even numbered years are leap years where month 6 has an extra day (15 days).

So what’s so special about the Jankle Bobit?  Well, that’s the focus of your lab today.

## Goals

* Write methods according to preconditions and postconditions.
* Implement a simple *JankleBobit* class with the specified methods.
* Prepare and use test cases for your implementation.

## Tasks

1. Read through the lab description. Once entirely before beginning.
2. Design test cases that will be used to test your program. Document these test cases in the [testing worksheet found here in this link](https://umassd.instructure.com/courses/20908/files/9731741?wrap=1 "TestCases.xlsx")[ **Download testing worksheet found here in this link**](https://umassd.instructure.com/courses/20908/files/9731741/download?download_frd=1)

   . You should complete the Rationale, Test Value and Expected Result sections completely. If you require more test case rows, please add them to the worksheet. Once you have completed this document, use it to test your program later.
3. Download the Source Code [JankleBobit.java](https://umassd.instructure.com/courses/20908/files/9731739?wrap=1 "JankleBobit.java")[ **Download JankleBobit.java**](https://umassd.instructure.com/courses/20908/files/9731739/download?download_frd=1)and [JankleBobitProgram.java](https://umassd.instructure.com/courses/20908/files/9731740?wrap=1 "JankleBobitProgram.java")[ **Download JankleBobitProgram.java**](https://umassd.instructure.com/courses/20908/files/9731740/download?download_frd=1). Prepare a Eclipse project for you work.
4. Write a Java implementation of the method "isLegitimate" according to its precondtion and postcondtion.
5. Write a Java implementation of the method "advanceDate" according to its precondition and postcondition.
6. Use the given *java* file to test your completed *JankleBobit.java* file, and make sure they work correctly. Use the test cases you prepared earlier (step 2.) to test your implementation. Document the results in the testing worksheet. If the program doesn’t match your expected results, determine if your program needs to be fixed, or if your expectation does. Document this as a note in the worksheet.
7. Submit the modified source file, *java, JankleBobitProgram and your test cases worksheet* to the myCourses.
